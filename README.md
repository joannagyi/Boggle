# Boggle

## Description
A code sample that makes the exciting Boggle game.

This was a previous C++ software project that turned the real-life game of Boggle into a programming one. 
It was a challenging yet rewarding experience to see it come to life.
This project is a C++ implementation of the Boggle game, where players find words on a randomly generated 4x4 board of letters. 
The program reads a board configuration from a file (boggle-in.txt) and provides an interactive game experience.
Each letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.


## Files
Some important files in this program include:
-- ospd.txt -- the official Scrabble player's dictionary (it contains 79,339 words).

-- boggle-in.txt -- a dice configuration file for the Boggle program.

-- boggle.exe -- a Windows executable with user selectable game level. 

## Files
-- Boggle.cpp -Incorporates all of the functions of the game including solve, search, checker, etc. <br>
-- Boggle.h - Outlines all of the needed functions for the game <br>
-- BoggleDriver.cpp - Stimulates the game by calling Boggle.h

These files were incorporated to integrate into the Boggle Game. 
-- Trie.cpp <br>
-- Trie.h <br>
-- TrieNode.cpp <br>
-- TrieNode.h

## Future Improvements
-- More board sizes (5x5, 6x6) <br>
